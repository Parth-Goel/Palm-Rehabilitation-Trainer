   - Windows: `hand_exercise_env\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source hand_exercise_env/bin/activate`

2. **Ensure you're in the project directory**:
   ```bash
   # Check current directory
   dir  # Windows
   ls   # macOS/Linux
   ```

### Step 2: Start the Application

Run the Streamlit application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 3: Access the Application

1. The application will automatically open in your default web browser
2. If it doesn't open automatically, go to: `http://localhost:8501`
3. You should see the Hand Exercise Detection App interface

## 📱 Using the Application

### Interface Overview

The application has three main sections:

1. **Demonstration Video**: Shows example exercises
2. **Live Hand Detection**: Real-time camera feed with exercise detection
3. **Reference Image**: Shows proper form for detected exercises

### How to Use

1. **Start Detection**:

   - Check the "Run Hand Detection" checkbox
   - Allow camera access when prompted

2. **Perform Exercises**:

   - Position your hand in front of the camera
   - Perform any of the 8 supported exercises
   - The system will detect the exercise and show feedback

3. **View Feedback**:
   - Exercise name appears on the video feed
   - Feedback messages guide your form
   - Reference image shows proper technique

### Exercise Tips

- **Good Lighting**: Ensure your hand is well-lit
- **Clear Background**: Use a plain background for better detection
- **Hand Position**: Keep your hand clearly visible to the camera
- **Steady Movement**: Move slowly and deliberately

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue 1: Camera not working**

- **Solution**: Check camera permissions in your browser
- **Alternative**: Try refreshing the page or restarting the application

**Issue 2: "Module not found" errors**

- **Solution**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated
- **Alternative**: Reinstall requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue 3: Application runs but no detection**

- **Solution**: Check if your webcam is working in other applications
- **Alternative**: Try changing camera index in the code (line 625: `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` instead of `cv2.VideoCapture(1)`)

**Issue 4: Slow performance**

- **Solution**: Close other applications using the camera
- **Alternative**: Reduce camera resolution in the code

**Issue 5: "Permission denied" errors**

- **Solution**: Run command prompt/terminal as administrator
- **Alternative**: Check folder permissions

### Getting Help

If you're still having issues:

1. **Check the console output** for error messages
2. **Verify your Python version**: `python --version`
3. **Check installed packages**: `pip list`
4. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

4. **Feedback Generation**: Exercise-specific feedback based on hand positions
5. **Visual Output**: Real-time video with overlays and reference images

### Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: 190 distance features + 39 angle features
- **Accuracy**: Typically 85-95% depending on lighting and hand position
- **Training Data**: Custom dataset of hand exercise recordings

## 🔄 Updating the Application

To update the application:

1. **Backup your data** (if you have custom models or data)
2. **Pull latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
3. **Update dependencies**:

   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 📊 Performance Tips

### For Better Detection

1. **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting
2. **Background**: Plain, uncluttered background
3. **Distance**: Keep hand 20-50cm from camera
4. **Angle**: Face camera directly
5. **Movement**: Move slowly and deliberately

### For Better Performance

1. **Close other applications** using the camera
2. **Use a dedicated GPU** if available
3. **Reduce browser tabs** and applications
4. **Restart application** if performance degrades
